# Zopsmart GoFr Project
 A simple GoFr mini project built by a Go getter ![1_dX7_Le4fztcY0QGbuk6KWA](https://github.com/galvinguy2002/Zopsmart-GoFr-Project/assets/119154626/8f2ec3d7-e5b2-4bfd-a119-ea370324247a)


 ## Net Requirements
Build a simple HTTP (REST) API using GoFr--
### 1. CRUD Operations: Build APIs for create, read, update and delete operations for all entities
  - [x] Create :white_check_mark:
  - [x] Create/Read :white_check_mark:
  - [x] Update/Delete :white_check_mark:
  

### 2. DB Integration: The API should have integration with database for persistence of data. Any SQL or NoSQL DB, which has a freely available docker image, may be used
  - [x] Database Creation :white_check_mark:
  - [x] Integration using Gofr :white_check_mark:
  

### 3. Unit Tests: A minimum of 60% unit test coverage is desired
- [x] All CRUD op represent approximate unit test coverage :white_check_mark:

- [x] Try to incorporate a real-world scenario while implementing the project. :white_check_mark:
    - [x] The real world scenario involves Stock Management API where user can retrieve details in relation with STOCKS. 
## Extra Points

- [ ] Unit Test Coverage > 90%
- [ ] Postman collection for trying out the APIs
- [x] Sequence diagrams, UML diagrams<br> :white_check_mark: <br>
[[ The following sequence diagram represents the outline of the API as complexity of the entire application and the interactions with the gofr package and the database is not possible here. ]] <br>
